            <description><![CDATA[<p>Daniel Buchner talks about the X-Tag project and some if its interesting features. The Web Platform Podcast discusses the Web Component specs and much more. Big companies like Google have thrown their full support behind the Web Components technology umbrella. Will others such as Microsoft follow suit? And what will it take for browser vendors to implement web components natively?</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Front-end expert John Rogerson offers some practical use cases and draws analogies to web dev approaches we are all already familiar with. John further discusses the pros of web components (modularity, extensibility), the cons (new technology, undefined standards, accessibility) and how they may reflect the future of web development.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>Andrew Rota &amp; Denis Radin talk about the ways you can leverage both Web Components &amp; React.js together in a symbiotic fashion. Denis, creator of Reactive Elements, starts us off explaining how his library came to be and why he chose to marry these two technologies in his work. Andrew, who spoke at ReactConf 2015 talks about his experiences with Web Components &amp; React as well.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[1096: Web Components with Cory House]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Carl and Richard talk to Cory House about the web component specification and what that will look like in your modern web development. As Cory explains, the key idea behind web components is to provide a framework for Javascript library extensibility that doesn&#39;t force you to own the library yourself.</p>
<!-- Excerpt -->
<p>While the standard is still being discussed, Cory mentions some libraries that have already gone ahead and implemented a variation of this extensibility, such as Steve Sanderson&#39;s amazing KnockoutJS. Web components make Javascript that much better to use!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[21: The X-Tag Project]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<p>Daniel Buchner talks with The Web Platform Podcast on x-tag, the Custom Elements library competitor to Polymer, that he created alongside former Mozillian &amp; Kraken Developer, Arron Schaar.</p>
<!-- Excerpt -->
<p>X-Tag is an interesting way to work with web components in that it takes a totally imperative approach to creating Web Components as opposed to the declarative way of building with libraries like Polymer. Some features include legacy browser support, optional mixins to share across components, &amp; functional pseudos to assist in delegation.</p>
